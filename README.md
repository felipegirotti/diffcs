```
composer install

## How To Use

### For public repositories:

Run the following command: `diffcs <source>/<project> <pull request id>`, where:

- `<source>` is the corporation/user behind the project;
- `<project>` is the project name on Github;
- `<pull request id>` is the pull request id, created by Github.

**Example**:

```
diffcs symfony/symfony 13342
```

### For private repositories:

Execute following command: `diffcs <source>/<project> <pull request id> --github-user=<github username>`, where:

- `<github username>` is your Github username.

**Example**:

```
diffcs symfony/symfony 13342 --github-user=seuusuario
```

Once you run this command, provide your Github password. **The password is only required to authenticate your credentials into the private repository.**
